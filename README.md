# findadoc-app
FindADoc is an app that allows users to find medical providers based on their specific needs. It seeks to address the limitations of specialty-based categorization by directly mapping physicians to diagnostic codes for diseases based on their Medicare payments data. The project is currently a work-in-progress with a web-deployable demo written in Python using Flask.
